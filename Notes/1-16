A header file must include:
#ifndef __ARR_H
#define __ARR_H
	...
#endif
otherwise it will break the header


"gcc -c " will allow for compiling when you don't have a main function


"gcc -c -std=c11 -ggdb3 main.c" for all c files in program -> returns main.o

"gcc -std=c11 -o main.exe main.o arr.o" to combine main.o and arr.o into main.exe


main.c => c program text, ASCII
main.o => object file, x86_64
main.exe => executable file, x86_64


Use valgrind on ix-dev. It checks memory allocation in runtime.

Checks if there are any mem alloc issues/bugs and for how many uses of free().


Use make to call a Makefile which will compile all components in the Makefile
