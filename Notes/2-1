Memory Allocation (c++):
- instead of malloc() we use new (variable type)
	int *intptr = new int;
	int *array = new int[10];
	int **array2D = new int*[5];
	for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
		array2D[i] = new int[5];
	}

- instead of free() we use delete (ptr name)
	delete intptr;
	delete []array;
	for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
		delete []array2D[i];
	}
	delete []array2d;

Commands (bash):
- top shows programs running on the machine
- ps shows precesses running on the machine and who is running them
